# Think of binary numbers: sequences of 0's and 1's.
# How many n-digit binary numbers are there that don't have
# two adjacent 1 bits?
# For example, for three-digit numbers,
# five of the possible eight combinations meet the criteria:
# 000, 001, 010, XXX011, 100, 101, XXX110, XXX111.

# What is the number for sequences of length 4, 5, 10, n?
